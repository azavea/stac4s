A scala project that provides types and basic functionality for working with [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs](https://stacspec.org). This library is the basis for projects like [Franklin]() and others.

### Usage



The following STAC types are covered by this library:
 - 2d- and 3d- Bounding Boxes
 - Collection
 - Asset
 - Catalog
 - Temporal and Spatial Extents
 - Item
 - License
 - Link & Link Types
 - Relations
 - Providers & Roles
 - Media Types

On its own this library does not provide much functionality; however, it can form a strong foundation for building catalogs and applications, especially when paired with libraries like [GeoTrellis Server]() and [GeoTrellis]().
